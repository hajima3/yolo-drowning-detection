# YOLO Collaboration Project

## Overview
The YOLO Collaboration Project is a software application designed to facilitate collaborative development and experimentation with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. This project aims to provide a structured environment for developers to contribute, test, and enhance the YOLO model.

## Features
- Easy setup for local development
- Modular architecture with controllers and routes
- Unit testing framework for ensuring code quality
- Continuous integration workflow for automated testing
